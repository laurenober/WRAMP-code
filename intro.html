    <div style="display: inline-block;">
        An <b>arc graph</b> is a visual display of an information using a half ring shape. An arc graph can be used to
        represent a proportion in a data.
        For example, the arc graph above shows a proportion of 1/4 or (25%) where 25%
        for the graphics is colored in blue, while the rest is kept pink. <br>
        <br> Proportions and percentages are also used to describe chances. For example, there is 25% of chance of
        raining tomorrow. However, people usually use expressions like "likely", "probably"
        when they talk about probabilities and chances.For example, "It will likely rain tomorrow", "There is only a
        little chance that I'll travel to Paris again" etc...

        <br> <br> In this study, <b> we are interested in the words and expressions that people use to describe
            probabilities shown in a data visualization like an arc graph. </b>
    </div>

    <p> <br> For this experiment, imagine yourself participating in a game in which you pick a marble out of hat full of
        colored marbles. Some marbles are pink, and the other marbles are blue. There are two outcomes in this game:
        <br>
        - if you draw a blue marble, you win, <br>
        - but if you draw a pink marble, you lose. <br>
    </p>
    <br> In the arc graph provided above, the blue section of the graph represents the proportion of blue
    marbles in the hat. A quarter of the total number of marbles in the hat is blue.
    <p>
        In general, the bigger the
        portion of blue arc is, the more blue marbles there are in the set and your chance of picking one will vary
        accordingly.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Your task: </b> For each question in this questionnaire, observe the visualization and describe
        your chance of picking a blue marble and winning the game.
        <br> Do <b>NOT</b> use numerical answer like<i> "The chance of drawing a blue marble is 25%"</i>. Instead, use
        familiar probability words and expressions to describe and communicate your chances.
    </p>
    Since this is a scientific experiment, your answers could be rejected if they do not follow these instructions
