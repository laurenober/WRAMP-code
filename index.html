            <h2>Unlikely? impossible? - How do you visualize it?</h2>
            <p>When uncertainty, odds, and (im)probabilities are communicated to us, we perceive and express them in
                different ways depending on our culture and the language that we use. The goal of this survey is to
                learn
                how people perceive and represent expressions of (im)probabilities in everyday life.

        <h3>Before you proceed, please read the following consent form carefully:</h3>
        <p>The goal of this research is to improve the communication of probabilistic information through data
            visualization. </p>
        <p>Procedure: You will be presented a fictitious context, as well as the directives and questions to which you
            can
            answer either by interacting with the visualizations or by typing your answer in the provided area. Do NOT
            provide numerical answer, think of words and expressions instead!<br>
        <p>What you will get out of it: You will expand your vocabulary related to probability and uncertainty, and
            learn
            about visual design and representations of uncertainty.</p>
        <p>Duration: The experiment will take you at most 18 minutes.</p>
        <p>Privacy: Your participation is anonymous and your responses cannot be used to identify you. </p>
        <p>Record keeping: Records of your participation will be held confidential so far as permitted by law. However,
            the
            study investigators and, under certain circumstances, the Worcester Polytechnic Institute Institutional
            Review
            Board (WPI IRB) will be able to inspect and have access to this data. Any publication or presentation of the
            data will not identify you. </p>

        <p>Your participation in this research is voluntary. Your refusal to participate will not result in any penalty
            to
            you or any loss of benefits to which you may otherwise be entitled. You may decide to stop participating in
            the
            research at any time without penalty or loss of other benefits. The project investigators retain the right
            to
            cancel or postpone the experimental procedures at any time they see fit.</p>
        <p>For more information about your rights as a research participant, or any concerns related to this study,
            please
